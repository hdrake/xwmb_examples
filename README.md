## Download the material

Several datasets can be downloaded for the workshop.
The notebooks already include download queries, but in order to save some time, you can already download the datasets directly from the Zenodo archives.

### CROCO tutorial

Download all netcdf files in [https://zenodo.org/records/18469910] and place them in the data/ directory.

### SOSE tutorial

Download first the `march` netcdf file in [https://zenodo.org/records/18681726] and place it in the data/ directory.
Optionally, you can also download the `january` dataset

## Install xwmb

You should be able to get the package and all its dependencies through pip:
```
pip install xwmb==0.5.5
```
Then, simply run a Jupyter session and start experimenting with the notebook of your choice.
